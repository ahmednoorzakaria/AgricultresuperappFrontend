# How to contribute to this project

- First clone the project repo on your machine: `git clone <repo url>`
- Before making any change, create feature branch. For example `git branch ft-mockdb.json`
- Then check to that branch: `git checkout ft-mockdb.json`
- Do your work on that branch.
- After completing your tasl and ready to push your work on remote:
- git check to your `main` branch and `git pull origin main` to pull any changes on your
  machine.
- Then branch again to your ready push branch `ft-mockdb.json` example above, then `git merge main` to merge it with `main`. If in that process you receive any merge conflict, please solve the merge conflict and then immediately push your branch changes online by command `git push origin ft-mockdb.json`

NB: `ft-mockdb.json` branch is used as an example as a branch. This process applies to all branches.
